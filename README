Challange resolution for Visual Nuts

This is the TS/node code for solving the challenge posed.
We have 3 ways of running it

#1 The easies one is use my repo on docker and the image will do everything (testing and running the scripts).
Just type on your terminal: docker run gustavotorregrosa/visualnuts:latest

#2 Using the docker-compose:
Enter the root folder and type: docker-compose up
Please, do not detatch, as we want to be able to see the logs that are generated by the script

#Running locally
npm install
tsc
npm run test
npm run exercise_1
npm run exercise_2
npm run start
